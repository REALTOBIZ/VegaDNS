** UPGRADING FROM 1.1.3 OR LOWER PLEASE READ **                 4/24/2005

1.1.4 is NOT compatible with 1.1.3 or lower.  There are many changes in the
database schema to accomodate the new permissions structure.  Before 2.0
release, I'll likely create a migration script.  In the meantime, you'll
have to start fresh.

NOTE:  1.1.4 is NOT meant for production, only testing.  It has bugs.



** UPGRADING FROM 0.9.9 OR LOWER PLEASE READ **                  2/9/2005

SRV Support has altered the database tables.  To make your database compatible,
just run these queries:

ALTER TABLE records ADD weight INT(4) AFTER distance;
ALTER TABLE records ADD port INT(4) AFTER weight;

ALTER TABLE default_records ADD weight INT(4) AFTER distance;
ALTER TABLE default_records ADD port INT(4) AFTER weight;



** UPGRADING FROM 0.9.8 OR LOWER PLEASE READ **                  2/4/2005

The smarty core code has been moved.  You will need to remove the old templates
to avoid errors by issuing:

sudo rm /usr/local/apache/vegadns/templates_c/*




** UPGRADING FROM 0.9b1 OR LOWER PLEASE READ **                 9/23/2004

You should remove the "> /dev/null" from your cron entry of update-data.sh.
update-data.sh now provides some errors, and you want to get them.





** UPGRADING FROM 0.7 OR LOWER PLEASE READ **                   5/19/2004

As of version 0.8, passwords are no longer stored as plain text, but rather as 
md5 hashes.  In order for your old passwords to work, you need to run the md5upgrade patch, which is located in the md5upgrade directory of your VegaDNS source.

To upgrade, just point your browser to:

http://your-server/vegadns-x.x/md5upgrade/index.php

(replacing your-server with your hostname, and x.x with your new version)

This script will verify that your accounts table does not have the correct 
Password field length.  It will then provide you with an upgrade link.  When 
you follow  this link, the Password field length will be changed for the 
accounts table, and then each password will be replaced with the corresponding
md5 hash.  Once this is complete, your users will be able to log in 
successfully.

Also note that since passwords are no longer stored in clear text, if you 
forget your password, the system will generate a new one for you upon request.
