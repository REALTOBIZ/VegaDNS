VegaDNS was written by Bill Shupp.  Initial Development was sponsored by George
Donnelly at Zettai.Net (http://www.zettai.net)

The initial database design was inspired by the one used with Inter7's dnsadmin:
http://inter7.com/dnsadmin/schema.txt

As of 1.1.4, the left menu, as well as the new subgroup structure,
are highly inspired by NicTool (www.nictool.com).  The dir_tree images directly
from NicTool, and the HTML is only slightly modified.

See CHANGELOG for specific contributions by users.
