As of version 0.8, passwords are no longer stored as plain text, but rather as
md5 hashes.  In order for your old passwords to work, you need to run the md5upgrade patch, which is located in the md5upgrade directory of your VegaDNS source.

To upgrade, just point your browser to:

http://your-server/vegadns-x.x/md5upgrade/index.php

(replacing your-server with your hostname, and x.x with your new version)

This script will verify that your accounts table does not have the correct
Password field length.  It will then provide you with an upgrade link.  When
you follow  this link, the Password field length will be changed for the
accounts table, and then each password will be replaced with the corresponding
md5 hash.  Once this is complete, your users will be able to log in
successfully.

Also note that since passwords are no longer stored in clear text, if you
forget your password, the system will generate a new one for you upon request.
